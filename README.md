## **Environment:**

- Anaconda: 23.3.1

- python: 3.11.0

  

## **Details**

- Type: term project
- Professor: Yan Yan
- Developing Language: Python
- Project Name: Product Recommendation Model
- Time: April/28/2023
- Description: Through a 3 layers of fully connected neural network test as a product recommendation model, the accuracy of the model is tested by splitting into train, validation, and test data set, and among 100 types of products, the accuracy of predicting the next purchased product reaches 10.725%.


## **Dependencies:** 

- Kaggle data set: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/instacart-market-basket-analysis/data



## **Install package:**

- torch: 1.13.1
- tdmq: 4.65.0
- pandas: 1.5.3
- numpy: 1.23.5
- matplotlib: 3.7.1




## **Run program:**

Method:

- Download Anaconda and necessary environment
- Download the [datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/instacart-market-basket-analysis/data)
- Run Data_Processing.ipynb file (First)
- Run Product_Recommendation_Model.ipynb file (Second)

(First): need data professing first
